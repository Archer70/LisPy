description: Avoids using unnecessary regex matching, when a direct string match will work fine.
alwaysApply: true

Avoid using `assertRaisesRegex` to match error/exception strings, unless absolutely necessary. Instead, prefer a direct string match like the following.
```
def test_count_arg_count_error_many(self):
    with self.assertRaises(EvaluationError) as cm:
        run_lispy_string('(count [] "")', self.env) # Vector and string as two args
    self.assertEqual(str(cm.exception), "SyntaxError: 'count' expects 1 argument, got 2.")
```
